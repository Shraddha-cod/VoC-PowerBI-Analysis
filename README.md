# 📊 Canva Voice of Customer (VoC) Analysis – Power BI Project
_End-to-end analysis of Canva customer reviews to identify, quantify, and prioritize key customer experience pain points_



## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Voice of Customer (VoC) analysis on Canva customer reviews** to identify recurring issues, dissatisfaction drivers, and improvement priorities.  
Using **Power BI**, unstructured customer feedback is transformed into **actionable insights** to support product, marketing, and customer experience decision-making.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, from raw feedback analysis to insight-driven visualization.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Canva receives a high volume of customer feedback across different touchpoints. However, raw review text makes it difficult to:
- Identify the most frequent customer pain points
- Measure dissatisfaction severity objectively
- Prioritize issues that require immediate attention

This project addresses the problem by combining **complaint volume** with **customer ratings** to highlight high-impact issues.
